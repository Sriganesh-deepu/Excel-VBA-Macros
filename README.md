# Excel-VBA-Macros
To store and showcase Macros
This is a respository to store the the macros created by me over the years.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Folder contains VBA code in separate files for quick access.
2. Folder also contains the excel workbook with data and code to run and demo the code.
3. The spreadsheets can be identified using file name
   for Example, 
  the file name -  Comment fill Macro_PPPM_Macro1 - indicates - 
      'Comment fill Macro' - File name - 
      'PPPM' - Reference to excel workbook in the folder - 
      'Macro1' - Reference to the sheet in the workbook where the macro is used.
